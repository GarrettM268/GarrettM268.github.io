# Garrett Mullings's personal website

This is a personal website that I created to showcase my projects and experiences. It is built using Vue3. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://garrettmullings.github.io/](https://garrettmullings.github.io/).

## Notes for me

### To run the website locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run serve`

### To deploy to the live website
1. Run `npm run deploy`
